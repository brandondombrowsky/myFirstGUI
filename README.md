# myFirstGUI
In this project I learned to code a graphical user interface with Java Swing, using absolute positioning. The widgets draw either a circle or square of the user's desired size and position using a single actionListener. We were not required to code validation or write test code.

> The build instructions to make myFirstGui work.
- Copy Java file into its own class with matching name.
- Run program from ShapeDrawing class.
- Non-integer data input into JTextFields will cause an exception when button clicked but not crash program.
