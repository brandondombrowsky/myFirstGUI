# myFirstGUI
This project had us learning to code a graphical user interface with Java Swing, using absolute positioning, that included widgets that draw either a circle or square of the user's desired size and position using a single actionListener. We were not required to code validation or write test code.

A. The included src file contains the single class:
  1. ShapDrawing -  GUI constructor, private inner class, and a Main

B. Running the code and triggering actionListener outputs GUI
  1. Draw a red, green, or blue circle between 100-400 pixels
  2. Draw a red, green, or blue square betwen 100-400 pixels
